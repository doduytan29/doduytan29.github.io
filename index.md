### [Mostly Good Robin Hood: Impact of Financial Transaction Tax on Corporate Investment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xCWChu_hDHoXa-PXiYGFtnhjTuFlNbVD/view?usp=sharing)
I exploit the 2012 French introduction of a financial transaction tax (FTT) levied on stock purchases to examine its impact on corporate investment. Investment may decrease due to the increased cost of capital. The FTT, however, may encourage investment by reducing short-termism. I find an overall positive effect of the FTT on corporate investments. I also find that the FTT causes a shift from short-term to long-term ownership, an improvement in investment sensitivity to changes in growth opportunities, and an increase in likelihood and quality of acquisitions. These results are in line with the prediction that the FTT encourages investment by inducing long-term ownership and alleviating short-termism.

### [Shareholder Voting and Disclosure in M\&As](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HkA2R1nfJ4ziebEW27PHxGMI1-jTiXhI/view?usp=sharing)
*with Beatriz García Osma, Anna Toldrà-Simats and Fengzhi Zhu (UC3M)*
We examine whether voting requirements in M\&As induce disclosure, lowering information asymmetry. We find that acquirers subject to shareholder voting provide more 8-K disclosure during the transaction period, and are more likely to provide timely disclosures of the merger agreement, as well as information on expected synergies and post-merger earnings forecasts. For acquirers subject to shareholder voting, we document that the association between disclosure and bid-ask spread is more negative than in other acquirers, and the association between disclosure and transient institutional sales is more positive. This suggests that disclosure is more informative and it can affect voting outcomes through changing the deal valuation and the shareholder base. Evidence from falsification tests and a regression-discontinuity design supports the causal interpretation of the positive effect of shareholder voting on disclosure.
